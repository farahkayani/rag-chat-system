There is no definitive answer as to how many pandas are in the wild. However, according to the official website of the Chinese zoo known as the Beijing Zoo, as of January 2021, their current total population was approximately 768 (https://www.beijingzoo.org/en/animals/conservation/species/53). The Chinese government has implemented various conservation measures to ensure the long-term survival and sustainability of pandas in the wild, such as protecting their natural habitat, providing food and resources for their breeding, and maintaining a minimum population size.
